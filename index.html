<h1>Queueing simulation</h1>
This page can be used to conduct a stochastic simulation of a queue, or a system of several queues.

<h4>Notes.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Older versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer cannot run this page.
Try a newer version, or another browser such as Firefox or Chrome.
<li>This is a client-side script, so the time it takes will depend on the
performance of the Web browser you are using, and of the computer it is running on.
Larger simulations will pop up a &ldquo;this is going to take a while&rdquo;
warning before they run. If you haven't seen that warning, you can expect
the simulation to be done within a few seconds.
<li>The routing boxes can take the name of a single queue, or the names of several queues (separated by commas).
With random routing, the probabilities are entered the same way.
With join-shortest-queue routing, ties are broken by sending customers to the queue that appears first in the list - this can introduce asymmetry into a system that otherwise looks symmetric.
<li>Simulations of different queueing systems using the same random number seed will have similar elements
(e.g. service times) where possible. This makes it possible to compare the systems by the method of common random
numbers.
<li>The system starts out empty (no customers) at the beginning of each run.
